Identify the potential errors in the following code snippets and modify 
them to include appropriate try/except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.

Example 1: Division
"""

Example 2: Opening Files
"""

"""
Example 3: List Items
"""

"""
Example 4: Dictionaries

"""
Example 5: Else/Finally
Modify the following code to include an else block to execute code if no exceptions occur 
and a finally block to ensure that a certain action is always performed, regardless of whether an exception is raised.
